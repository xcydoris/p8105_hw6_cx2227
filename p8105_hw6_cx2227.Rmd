## Problem 1

```{r}
birthweight = read_csv("./data/birthweight.csv")

str(birthweight)

birthweight = birthweight %>% 
mutate(
  babysex = factor(babysex),
    frace = factor(frace),
    mrace = factor(mrace),
    malform = factor(malform)
  )

options(scipen=999)
fit = lm(bwt ~ blength + delwt + gaweeks + malform + menarche + momage + pnumlbw + ppbmi + ppwt + wtgain,
         data = birthweight)
fit %>% broom::tidy()

birthweight %>% 
  add_predictions(fit) %>% 
  add_residuals(fit) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = resid, y = pred)) + geom_violin() +
  labs(
    x = "Residuals",
    y = "Predictions"
  )
```

 - This model is built by selecting some factors I thought would be attrbutng to the weight of the baby, for example: the length of the baby, mother’s pre-pregnancy BMI, mother’s age at menarche, etc...

 - However, through the chart, there is no clear interaction, so this model proposed is not effective.
